The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean is a $180-$250 toothbrush. Have I lost you already? I should have.
<br><br><br>

It has an app. Why does it have an app?
<br><br><br>
The app requires <em>always-on</em> location and bluetooth access?
Still here?
<br><br><br>

Buying this tooth brush is paying for someone to work full time on toothbrush technology. Would you hire a full stack 
toothbrush developer? No!?! Great then don't buy the tooth brush.

Ignore your dentists recommendations. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbfu39l0kxg'>Be your own boss.</a> Follow your wildest dreams.

There is too much real work to be done for us to be employing full time tooth brush developers.
