<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>MofDB is an api/webfront-end and database I built for the <a href="http://www.iec.northwestern.edu/">Snurr Research Group at Northwestern</a>. The database
contains the results of high throughput screenings of metal organic frameworks with the goal of finding materials that will
be helpful for gas separations like Xe/Kr Co2 adsorption etc.</p>

<p>The database provides a way to share data with other researchers in an easily accesible json format that was developed by <a href="https://adsorbents.nist.gov/">NIST</a> for their own database of similar data. This makes
data interoperable for researchers using data from both systems.</p>

<h3 id="front-end">Front End</h3>

<p>The front end of mofDB is a essentially a collection of filters (left column) that trigger a new request to the api. When the filters are adjusted the api is called and the table (right column) you see on the homepage is swapped out.

<h3 id="api">API</h3>

<p>The mofDB project is difficult because of itâ€™s scale there are easily 400,000 materials with a dozen properties each, and a handful of children models with even more data. 
A common use case for  researchers is to download all of the data from a given set of materials (often ~100k) within mofDB.  This means we need
to be able to compile and serve that information in near real time. This is acheived by caching a json copy of all materials so
that a query can simply concat them together before devivering them to the user. Before this caching it took about ~10ms * # of materials.
Which was clearly too slow for numbers in the 100,000s.</p>

<p>The api also provides all the same search functions as the front-end (which of course uses the api). Like filtering by material properties,
what atoms are present in the material, and what isotherms the material has. The api is documented <a href="https://mof.tech.northwestern.edu/api">here</a>.</p>

<p>All front-end routes are also available as json by adding the .json suffix.
