<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>FACETS is a tool I built at Northwestern University to track professors through the tenure process at Northwestern university. The tool gets used by the administration, faculty, and professors at other universities to compile all the information 
needed to discuss a tenure case.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this system is only accessible to professor @ Northwestern so you likely cannot see the <a href="https://facets.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">live site</a>. There are many screenshots below.</p>

<h3 id="tech">Tech</h3>

<p>FACETS is essentially a complicated file storage system that provisions access on the fly based on human resources data.
The system parses those apis responses to determine if someone is a professor, what kind of professor they are, and then decides which cases
and how much of each case they can view. The system also allows for custom roles to be added to users like Department Administrator,
Dean, Provost, etc. which all allow different levels of access.</p>

<p>The other complexity the system handles is allowing people who do not have access to a Northwestern University single-sign-on account (netid) to access the system to upload their reference letters (about faculty up for tenure).
To handle these people I design facets to generate secure one time use tokens that can be emailed and allow the recipient to upload
a single document into the case (and then revoke access). The tokens look something like this <a href="#">facets.mccormick.northwestern.edu/tokens/35783cf2672835428f8c08f88c9f7da3b024d292</a>.</p>

<p>The coolest features for the end users are,</p>

<ol>
  <li>PDF merge of entire case or selected docs (I swear MANY people merge the case into one pdf and print it),</li>
  <li>ZIP of selected documents</li>
  <li>Auto file naming (previously the deparment administrators renamed all files by hand to match a convention)</li>
  <li>Drag and drop file upload (dropzone.js -&gt; rails endpoint)</li>
</ol>

<p>Hereâ€™s a few of those features</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Index of current cases</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/images/facets/cases.png" alt="multiple cases" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A particular case and its subfolders, notice the PDF and ZIP buttons</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/images/facets/case_expanded.png" alt="single case view" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drag and drop document upload within a folder</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/images/facets/drag_and_drop.png" alt="two files being dragged and dropped to upload" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Editing a user with custom roles</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/images/facets/user%20view%20edit.png" alt="editting a user" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating a token (this is something an admin would do), they then click the copy icon and email the token.</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/images/facets/copy%20token.png" alt="creating a token text field" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a token (limited system access for external people)</p>
